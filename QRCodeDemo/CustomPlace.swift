        // lets say you created 2 outlet as placeNameLabel, and distanceLabel, you can set
        // them like following:
        view.placeNameLabel.text = placeName
        view.distanceLabel.text = distance
        
        // Once your view is ready set iconView property coming from inheriting to
        // your view as following:
        
        iconView = view
        appearAnimation = .pop //not necessarily but looks nice.
